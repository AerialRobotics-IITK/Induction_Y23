## IMPLEMENTATIONS
I have tried to implement all the commands that user can have
I have made a new directory by using the os module in python where I store all the files that any client wants to share
I have created 3 lists of clients,their usernames and passwords. I check for whether an entered username exists in the list already or not and then code works accordingly.
 

## Functions
 for storing and retreiving
I have created deedicated functions for storing and retrieving files and have tried to handle errors in case the file is not found,etc.
The admin fcuntionality is not operational currently, but will update it soon
