# Assignment 5 (ETHZ Exercise 3)

The submission consists of the src folder of the *smb2_ws* workspace and 2 recordings
of the gazebo simulation

**NOTE**

The *smb2_highlevel_controller* package has been implemented manually by yours truly without any package building tools like *catkin_create_pkg*

The launch file for the entire project is *world_launch_2.launch* in the 
*/src/smb2_highlevel_controller/launch/* directory
