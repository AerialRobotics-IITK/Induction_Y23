# FTP SERVER

This ftp server can perform the following funtions :

### As an user:

1.) It can authenticate a user by taking it's username and password.<br>
2.) Can list all the files present in the current working directory.<br>
3.) Retrieve a file from the server and store a file on the server.<br>
4.) The quit command is used to disconnect from the server.<br>

### As an admin:

It can add ,delete ,ban and unban an user from the server.<br>

NOTE : I have also written two client codes ,one of an admin and the other of a user to test all the functionalities of the server.
