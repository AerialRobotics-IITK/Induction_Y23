## Docker_task_1
---
1. Connected to teleop_twist_keyboard and it is working properly as shown in the image in the images folder
2. The launch file shows everything needed to run the smb_simulation, I clicked the image a bit later during this project, so it has some stuff which will be introduced in future tasks

## Docker_task_2
---
1. image_3 shows the node being implemented
2. image_4 is taken from task 3 while the robot moves toward the pillar,
but shows that the distance from the pillar is being shown as output on the screen.
3. yes a parameter file is used called smb_highlevel_params.yaml.
4. Unfortunately i lost track of all the docker images and was midway between task 3, while writing this, I will add the pillar being shown in RViz as a image asap, later but it is working.

## Docker_task_3

1. for now i have been able to accomplish publishing /cmd_vel to the robot using a new node, I need to make it move towards the pillar(provide proper angular_vel and slow down the speed). Will update the repo as soon as i complete it.
